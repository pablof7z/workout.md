# Agent Notes

This directory is proactive-context generated project memory. It is useful repo
state, not scratch output.

- Be proactive about committing generated `docs/wiki` changes with the code or
  docs change they explain. If wiki changes accumulated during your work, include
  them intentionally or call them out before handing off. Or run
  `pc install --git-hooks` once to have this happen automatically via a git
  post-commit hook.
- Do not hand-edit `_index.md` or `_citations.log`; they are derived caches.
- `_citations/` is the merge-friendly citation source of truth. Treat existing
  citation records as immutable evidence receipts.
- Preserve inline `[^id]` markers in guides. They are the link from prose back to
  transcript evidence.
